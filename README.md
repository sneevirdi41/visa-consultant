## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd visa_consulatant
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Database Setup
The application uses SQLite by default, which creates a file-based database automatically. The database file `GuruKirpaVisaConsultancy.db` will be created in the project root when you first run the application.

If you need to change the database location, update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=GuruKirpaVisaConsultancy.db"
  }
}
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will:
- Create the database automatically
- Seed initial data (admin user, homepage content, sample services)
- Start the web server

### 5. Access the Application
